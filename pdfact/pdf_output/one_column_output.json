Performing these analytic continuations in some cases is beyond our current knowledge, even for simple models. We employ a numerical method based on rational interpolations to extrapolate the entanglement entropy of two disjoint intervals for the conformal field theories given by the free compact boson and the Ising model. The case of three disjoint intervals is studied for the Ising model and the non compact free massless boson. For the latter model, the logarithmic negativity of two disjoint intervals has been also considered. Some of our findings have been checked against existing numerical results obtained from the corresponding lattice models."

    "text": "Entanglement measures have been the focus of an intense research activity in condensed matter theory, quantum information, quantum field theory and quantum gravity during the last decade. The most celebrated one among them is the entanglement entropy, which measures the entanglement between two complementary parts when the whole system is in a pure state [1]. Considering a quantum system in its ground state |Ψ〉, or in any other pure state, and assuming that its Hilbert space is factorized as H = HA ⊗ HB, the A's reduced density matrix is defined as ρA ≡ TrBρ, being ρ = |Ψ〉〈Ψ| the density matrix of the whole system. The reduced density matrix ρA, which characterizes a mixed state, is normalized by requiring that TrAρA = 1. The entanglement entropy SA is the Von Neumann entropy associated to ρA. Analogously, one can introduce SB and, since ρ corresponds to a pure quantum state, we have that SB = SA. In quantum field theory, the entanglement entropy is usually computed by employing the replica limit, namely SA ≡ − Tr(ρA log ρA) = nli→m1 SA(n) , (1.1) where SA(n) are the Rényi entropies, which are defined as follows SA(n) ≡ log1T−r(nρnA) . (1.2) From this expression and the normalization condition for ρA, it is straightforward to find that SA = −∂nTr(ρnA)|n=1. Typically, SA(n) is known for positive integers n and therefore it must be analytically continued to real values of n in order to perform the replica limit (1.1)."

In many cases the coefficient of the leading divergence is proportional to the area of ∂A and this property is known as the area law for the entanglement entropy. This rule has some important exceptions and the main one is a generic two dimensional conformal field theory (CFT) at zero temperature. Considering an infinite line and an interval of length as the subsystem A, we have that ∂A is made by the two endpoints of the interval and it is well known that SA = (c/3) log( /a) + const, where c is the central charge of the model [2, 3] (see also [4] for a review)."

    "text": "Another interesting quantity to consider is the logarithmic negativity, which is a measure of entanglement for bipartite mixed states [21]. Let us consider a pure or mixed state characterized by the density matrix ρ acting on a bipartite Hilbert space H = H1⊗H2 and the arbitrary bases |ei(1)〉 and |ej(2)〉 for H1 and H2 respectively. The important object to introduce is the partial transpose of ρA1∪A2 with respect to one of the two parts. Considering e.g. the partial transposition with respect to the second part, the matrix element of ρAT21∪A2 is defined as follows Then, the logarithmic negativity is given by E ≡ log Tr|ρAT21∪A2 | , (1.6) where Tr|ρAT21∪A2 | is the trace norm of the hermitean matrix ρAT21∪A2 , which is the sum of the absolute values of its eigenvalues. Taking into account the traces Tr(ρAT21∪A2 )n of integer powers of ρAT21∪A2 , it is not difficult to observe that a parity effect occurs. In particular, considering the sequence of the odd powers n = no and the one of the even powers n = ne, the logarithmic negativity (1.6) can be found through the following replica limit [22, 23] E = nlei→m1 log Tr(ρAT21∪A2 )ne . (1.7) Notice that for no → 1 one simply recovers the normalization condition TrρAT21∪A2 = 1. For a bipartite pure state a relation occurs between Tr(ρAT21∪A2 )n and the Renyi entropies which tells us that the logarithmic negativity reduces to the Rényi entropy of order n = 1/2. However, we are interested in the logarithmic negativity of mixed states and the reduced density matrix is an important example. Thus, given a quantum system in a pure state and considering the reduced density matrix ρA1∪A2 of two adjacent or disjoint spatial regions, while SA1∪A2 measures the entanglement between A1 ∪ A2 and the complementary region B, the logarithmic negativity in (1.6) measures the entanglement between A1 and A2 (see Fig. 1, bottom panel, for one spatial dimension)."

We consider some of these models for two or three disjoint intervals (only some configurations in the latter case) and employ a numerical method based on rational interpolations to get the corresponding entanglement entropy or logarithmic negativity. This extrapolating method has been first suggested in this context by [20] (see [29] for other numerical methods). We checked our extrapolations against numerical results found through the corresponding lattice models whenever they are available in the literature, finding very good agreement; otherwise the method provides numerical predictions that could be useful benchmarks for future studies."

In these cases F2,n(x) is written in terms of the Riemann theta function, which is defined as follows [32] Θ[e](z|Ω) ≡ ∑ exp [ i(m + ε)t · Ω · (m + ε) + 2πi(m + ε)t · (z + δ)] , (2.8) where Ω is a p × p symmetric complex matrix with positive immaginary part and z ∈ Cp/(Zp + ΩZp) is a complex p dimensional vector. The vector et ≡ (εt, δt) is the characteristic of the Riemann theta function (2.8), being ε and δ two p dimensional vectors whose elements are either 0 or 1/2. The characteristic provides the parity of (2.8) as function of z, which is the same one of the integer number 4εt · δ, indeed Θ[e](−z|Ω) = (−1)4ε·δ Θ[e](z|Ω) . (2.9) It is not difficult to realize that there are 2p−1(2p + 1) even characteristics and 2p−1(2p − 1) odd ones. Since in this paper we always deal with z = 0, we find it convenient to lighten the formulas by introducing the notation Θ[e](Ω) ≡ Θ[e](0|Ω) and Θ(Ω) ≡ Θ[0](Ω). The Riemann theta functions throughout this paper have been evaluated by using Mathematica through the built-in function SiegelTheta."

The chain has L sites and ∆ is the anisotropy. The mutual information for this lattice model has been computed in [6] by direct diagonalization for L 6 30. When h = 0 and −1 < ∆ 6 1 the model in the continuum is described by the c = 1 compact boson with η = 1 − (1/π) arccos ∆, while for h = 0 an explicit formula providing η does not exist and therefore it must be found numerically. The CFT formulas reviewed above can be applied also to the case of a finite system of length L with periodic boundary conditions by employing a conformal mapping from the cylinder to the plane. As final result, the CFT formulas for this case are obtained by considering the expressions for the infinite line and replacing any length i with the corresponding chord length (L/π) sin(π i/L) [3]."

The latter one is characterized by two positive integer parameters p and q, which are the degrees of the numerator and of the denominator respectively. As explained in §, to perform a rational interpolation characterized by the pair (p, q) we need at least p + q + 1 known data. An important technical difficulty that one encounters is the evaluation of the Riemann theta functions for large genus period matrices, i.e. for high values of n. Given the computational resources at our disposal, we were able to compute Riemann theta functions containing matrices whose size is at most 12.

All the rational interpolations in the figure exhibit a good agreement with the numerical data, despite the low values of p and q. Increasing these parameters, a better approximation is expected but the result is already stable for these values and we provided two rational interpolations for each curve as a check. Some rational interpolations may display some spurious bahaviour in some regimes of x. As discussed in detail in §, this possibility increases with q. These results have been discarded and we showed only rational interpolations which are well-behaved in the whole domain x ∈ (0, 1). Notice that rational interpolations that are well-behaved for some η and x could display some bad behaviour changing them. Thus, the values of (p, q) must be chosen case by case. In Fig. 2 the dashed grey lines are obtained from the analytic continuation (2.12) found in [7], which corresponds to the decompactification regime and therefore it reproduces the numerical data from the XXZ chain and from the rational interpolations only for small η, as expected."

Since (2.15) contains Riemann theta functions, we cannot consider high values for n, like for the compact boson.

Given our computational power, we have computed the Rényi entropies up to n = 7 and in Fig. 3 we show the rational interpolations found by choosing three different pairs (p, q) which are well-behaved among the available ones.

When η 1 the expression in (3.7) becomes For computational purposes, it is important to observe that in (3.8) the Riemann theta function is evaluated for τN, which is g × g, while for finite η, when (3.7) holds, the matrix occurring in the Riemann theta function is 2g × 2g. This implies that for the non compact boson we can reach higher values of n and therefore the corresponding numerical extrapolation is more precise. In the decompactification regime we can also appreciate the convenience of considering the normalization (3.3). Indeed, plugging (3.8) into (3.6) one obtains an expression which is η independent As for the Ising model, since the results of [31] about the bosonization on higher genus Riemann surfaces for c = 1 models hold for a generic genus, we can straightforwardly write the generalization to N > 2 of the N = 2 formula (2.15). Indeed, given the period matrix τN employed for the compact boson in (3.7), we have that TrρAn for the Ising model is (3.5) with c = 1/2 and [31, 19] FN,n(x) = ∑2eg||ΘΘ[(eτ]N(τ)N|)| . (3.10) The Riemann theta functions in this formula are evaluated for the g × g period matrix and a sum over all the characteristics occurs. It is worth remarking that the Riemann theta functions in (3.10) with odd characteristics vanish and therefore the sum contains 2g−1(2g + 1) terms. In [19] the formula (3.10) has been checked numerically on the lattice for n = 2, various N and different configurations of intervals by employing the Matrix Product States. To our knowledge, numerical results for IN with N > 3 are not available in the literature for the critical Ising chain in transverse field."

The Hamiltonian of the harmonic chain with L lattice sites and with nearest neighbour interaction reads where periodic boundary conditions are imposed. Rewriting (3.15) in terms of a ≡ √M/K and ω through a canonical transformation, one can observe that it provides the lattice discretization of the free boson with mass ω and lattice spacing a. Thus, the continuum limit of the ω = 0 case is the decompactified boson discussed above. The method to compute Rényi entropies for the lattice model (3.15) is well known [35] and TrρAn can be found from the correlators 〈qrqs〉 and 〈prps〉. Let us recall that setting ω to zero leads to a divergent expression for 〈qrqs〉 because of the zero mode occurring for periodic boundary conditions. In [19] the method discussed in [35] has been applied to perform various checks of the CFT formulas for the non compact boson at fixed n. Moreover, also INsub has been found from the harmonic chain data, but a comparison with the analytic results has not been done because the analytic continuation of the corresponding Rényi entropies is not known yet. Indeed, the Riemann theta function occurs in (3.8) and its analytic continuation in n is still an open problem. As for the values of ω, in [19] it has been checked that ωL = 10−5 is small enough to capture the CFT regime through the periodic harmonic chain. The numerical data for the periodic harmonic chain have been found by setting M = K = 1 and ωL = 10−5 in (3.15). The same quantities evaluated for ωL = 10−3 turned out to be indistinguishable."

For each set of data, we show two different rational interpolations which are well-behaved in order to check the stability of the result. The differences between different well-behaved rational interpolations are very small and the agreement with the numerical data from the harmonic chain is very good, supporting the validity of the extrapolating method. In Figs. 4 and 5 we have employed 2 6 n 6 6. It is worth remarking at this point that the Riemann theta functions occurring in the CFT expression (3.14) for the non compact boson contain at most g × g matrices (g = 2(n − 1) for N = 3) while for the compact boson their size is at most 2g × 2g (see (3.7)). From the computational viewpoint, this is an important difference because the higher is n that can be addressed, the higher is the number of different (p, q) that can be considered in the rational interpolations. Thus, the maximum n that we can deal with is related to the maximum size of the matrices in the Riemann theta functions occurring in the model. Nevertheless, from Figs. 4 and 5 we observe that, for this case, rational interpolations with low values of (p, q) are enough to capture the result expected from the lattice data."

We have considered the following configurations of three intervals specified by a parameter α (see the inset of Fig. 4 for the notation) (d) i = , d1 = d2 = α , d3 = L − (3 + 2α) . (3.17) In particular, the results in Fig. 6 correspond to α = 0.25 (left panel) and α = 2 (right panel), where the dots denote the values of IA(n1),A2,A3 for n ∈ {2, 3, 4}. Unfortunately, with the computational resources at our disposal, we could not compute Rényi entropies for higher values of n. Indeed, besides the problem of computing the Riemann theta function numerically for large period matrices, the additional obstacle occurring for the Ising model is that the number of elements in the sum (3.10) grows exponentially with n. Given the few n's available, only few rational interpolations can be employed to approximate the analytic continuation to n = 1 and they are depicted in Fig. 6 through solid and dashed lines (in general we never use (p, q) = (0, 1) because is often not well-behaved). It is interesting to observe that the three different rational interpolations provide the same extrapolation to n = 1 for a large range of x2 (they differ when x2 is close to 1). Since, to our knowledge, numerical results about IA1,A2,A3 for the Ising model are not available in the literature, the curves in Fig. 6 are predictions that would be interesting to test through other methods. In order to check the reliability of the numerical method, we have performed rational interpolations considering only n ∈ {3, 4} to extrapolate the value at n = 2, which is known analytically. Since only two points are available, only the rational interpolation with (p, q) = (1, 0) can be done, which is given by the dot-dashed curve in Fig. 6. Despite the roughness of the extrapolation due to the few input points, the agreement with the expected values computed with the analytic expression (black dots) is very good."

In order to briefly mention the main idea, let us consider a subsystem A = ∪Ni=1Ai made by N disjoint intervals Ai = [ui, vi]. The traces TrρAn in CFT are given by the correlators of twist fields in (3.5). Denoting by A0 A a set of N0 < N disjoint intervals among the ones in A and by ρAT0 the partial transpose of ρA with respect to A0, we have that Tr(ρAT0 )n in CFT is the correlation function of twist fields obtained by placing Tn in ui and T̄n in vi when Ai ∈ A \\ A0, and T̄n in ui and Tn in vi when Ai ∈ A0. The corresponding logarithmic negativity E, which measures the entanglement between A0 and A \\ A0, can be computed by considering the sequence of the even integers ne and taking the replica limit (1.7). Configurations containing adjacent intervals are obtained as limiting cases and the fields Tn2 and T̄n2 occur."

Plugging (4.3) into (4.2) and taking the replica limit (1.7) of the resulting expression, since ∆1 = 0 and c1 = 1, we find that the logarithmic negativity of two disjoint intervals in CFT is given by E(x) = nlei→m1 log Gne (x) = nlei→m1 log F2,ne (x/(x − 1)) , (4.4) telling us that the logarithmic negativity is scale invariant, being a function of the ratio x only. In order to get rid of the prefactor in (4.2), it is convenient to consider the following ratio where (4.3) has been employed in the last step. Since F2,1(x) = 1 for x ∈ (0, 1) because of the normalization of ρA, the logarithmic negativity can be found also by taking the replica limit of (4.5), namely E(x) = log nlei→m1 R̃ne (x) , (4.6) Notice that, since for n = 2 we have that T2 = T̄2, one concludes that R̃2 = 1 identically."

For the non compact boson the expression (4.9) is not difficult to evaluate numerically. Thus, we can deal with high values of n and therefore we have many possibilities for (p, q). It turns out that an accurate extrapolation for the logarithmic negativity requires high values of p and q, in particular for the regime of small intervals x ∼ 0 (see Fig. 11 in § for extrapolations having low p and q). As already remarked in [22, 23], the behaviour of E(x) when x ∼ 0 is not power-like. We observed, as a general behaviour, that increasing q leads to extrapolations which are closer to the numerical data, but spurious fluctuations or even singularities in some regimes of x can occur (see the black and magenta curves in the inset of Fig. 8, and the dashed magenta and cyan curves in Fig. 11). This happens whenever one of the q poles of the rational function is close to the range (1, nmax) of the interpolated data and not too far from n = 1 (it may be real or have a small imaginary part).

Its reliability has been checked by reproducing the existing results found from the corresponding lattice models through various techniques like exact diagonalizations [6, 19] and Tree Tensor Networks [9]. In our analysis, we observed that for the entanglement entropy one finds the same curve through different extrapolations already with small values of the degrees p and q of the polynomials occurring in the numerator and in the denominator respectively of the rational interpolation. Instead, for the logarithmic negativity higher values of p and q are needed for the regime of distant intervals, where it falls off faster than any power. Extrapolations having higher values of q are more efficient in providing the expected result, but they can show some spurious behaviour in some parts of the domain. Our numerical analysis has been limited both by our computational resources (in the evaluation of the Riemann theta functions for large matrices) and by the features of the model (e.g. for the logarithmic negativity of distant intervals). These obstacles prevented us to treat some interesting cases like the logarithmic negativity of two disjoint intervals for the compact boson and for the Ising model because high values of n are needed to get convincing extrapolations. We remark that lattice results for E(x) have been found in [28] for the Ising model through Tree Tensor Networks, while for the compact boson they are not available in the literature (see [37] for R̃3 obtained through Quantum Monte Carlo)."

For any integer n > 2 we have a real function of x and typically we have access only to n 6 nmax for computational difficulties. The rational function interpolating the given data reads being p ≡ deg(P) and q ≡ deg(Q) the degrees of the numerator and of the denominator respectively as polynomials in n. The extrapolations are performed pointwise in the domain x ∈ (0, 1). Thus, for any given x ∈ (0, 1), in (A.1) we have p + q + 2 coefficients to determine. Nevertheless, since we can divide both numerator and denominator by the same number fixing one of them to 1, the number of independent parameters to find is p + q + 1. Once the coefficients in (A.1) have been found, the extrapolation is easily done by considering n real and setting it to the needed value. It is important to stress that, having access only to a limited number m of data points, we can only perform rational interpolations whose degrees (p, q) are such that p + q + 1 6 m.

    "text": "In Fig. 9 we consider an explicit example where we extrapolate the Ĩ1(x) in (2.7) of the compact boson (c = 1) for a particular value of the compactification radius corresponding to η = 0.295 (see also Fig 2). For n > 2 the analytic expressions are (2.6) and (2.10) and we take into account 2 6 n 6 6 only (in Fig. 2 we employ also n = 7). Given these data, we can perform rational interpolations with p + q + 1 6 5. The blue curve in Fig. 9 is the extrapolation to n = 1 of the rational interpolation with (p, q) = (2, 2). We find it instructive to describe the details for a specific value of x. Let us consider, for instance, a configuration corresponding to x = x̃ ≡ 0.2101 (see the dashed rectangle in Fig. 9). First one has to compute the rational interpolation with (p, q) = (2, 2), then the limit n → 1 must be taken. For these two steps, we find respectively W(n2,2)(x̃) = 0.315+8 −1.304.478n0 +n +7.837.608n92n2 , nli→m1 W(n2,2)(x̃) = 0.349 . (A.2) In the inset of Fig. 9 we show how adding more data improves the final extrapolation and how it becomes stable. Focusing again on x = x̃, we can start by taking only n ∈ {2, 3}, which allow to perform a rational interpolation with (p, q) = (1, 0) (a line). Since rational interpolations having p = 0 often provide wrong predictions, we prefer to avoid them, if possible. The extrapolation to n = 1 corresponding to (p, q) = (1, 0) cannot be trusted and therefore we consider four input data n ∈ {2, 3, 4, 5} which allow to consider a rational interpolation with, for instance, (p, q) = (3, 0) and also (p, q) = (1, 1). These two different rational interpolations do not provide the same extrapolation to n = 1 and therefore we must take into account more input data. Considering 2 6 n 6 6 we can choose also (p, q) = (2, 2) finding that the corresponding rational interpolation basically coincides with the one with (p, q) = (1, 1) (their difference is of order 10−3). Thus, the extrapolation to n = 1 obtained with (p, q) = (2, 2) is quite stable. Repeating this analysis for the whole range of x ∈ (0, 1), one can find the blue curve in Fig. 9. As a further check, in Fig. 2 we have used (p, q) = (3, 2) using more input data, finding that the final extrapolation is basically the same. Plots like the one shown in the inset of Fig. 9 are very useful to understand the stability of the extrapolation to n = 1. Increasing the values of p and q in the rational interpolations leads to more precise extrapolations, as expected. Rational interpolations with q > 0 provide extrapolations which are closer to the expected value with respect to the ones with q = 0. When q is strictly positive, q poles occur in the complex plane parameterized by n ∈ C. Nevertheless, if these poles are far enough from the real interval (1, nmax) containing all the n's employed as input data for the interpolation, the extrapolations to n = 1 are reliable. Increasing q, we have higher probability that one of the poles is close to the region of interpolation, spoiling the extrapolation. Plotting W(np,q)(x) as function of n is useful to realize whether this situation occurs (see the inset of Fig. 10 for an explicit example)."

Indeed, F3,n(x) in (3.14) is given by (3.7) for N = 3 and therefore the matrix occurring in the Riemann theta function is 2g × 2g with g = 2(n − 1). Given our computational power, we computed IA(n1),A2,A3 for n ∈ {2, 3} for all the needed configurations of intervals, while for n = 4 we got results only for small intervals. In Fig. 10 we show our data and some numerical extrapolations. In the whole range of x2 we performed only the rational interpolation with (p, q) = (1, 0) (blue line) because only two input data are available, while for x2 ∈ (0, 0.22), where also n = 4 is available, we could employ higher values of p and q. When we have more extrapolations, unfortunately they do not overlap, indicating that we cannot trust these curves to give a prediction, even if they are quite close. Another indication that n = 4 is not enough to get a precise extrapolation comes from the fact that, given the data with n ∈ {3, 4} and extrapolating to n = 2 (orange curve in Fig. 10) we did not recover exactly the expected values (purple circles) found with the analytic expressions. In the inset we focus on a configuration of three intervals corresponding to x2 = 0.224 and show the dependence of IA(n1),A2,A3 on n for various (p, q). While the extrapolations to n = 1 associated to (1, 0) (for this one only n ∈ {2, 3} have been used), (1, 1) and (2, 0) are very close, the one corresponding to (p, q) = (0, 2) provides a completely different extrapolation to n = 1. Considering the two poles of the interpolating function in the regime of x2 where also n = 4 is available, we find that they are real and at least one of them is inside the domain n ∈ (1, 4). Thus, the function cannot be considered a good approximation of the true analytic continuation and the extrapolation cannot be trusted. This behaviour does not occur for the case considered in the inset of Fig. 9. Thus, it is useful to plot the n dependence of the functions obtained through the rational interpolation method in order to check the occurrence of singularities that could lead to wrong extrapolations."

    "text": "We find it instructive to discuss some details about the extrapolations of the logarithmic negativity of two disjoint intervals (see §). The simplest case we can deal with is the non compact boson and the replica limit to perform for this model is (4.8). The analytic expression (4.9) contains only hypergeometric functions and therefore it can be evaluated for high values of n. Some extrapolations performed through the rational interpolation method explained above are shown in Figs. 8 and 11. The first difference between the logarithmic negativity and the mutual information in the extrapolation process is that for the former quantity we need to consider higher values of p and q with respect to the latter one to recover the expected result. Moreover, in the regime of small intervals or large separation (i.e. x ∼ 0), where the logarithmic negativity falls off to zero faster than any power, it is very difficult to capture its behaviour in a clean way, despite the high values of p and q. In Fig. 11 we show some extrapolations characterized by low values of p and q. The most difficult regime to capture is the one with x ∼ 0. Thus, in Fig. 8 we show some extrapolations having higher values of p and q. Comparing the curves in these figures, one observes that with low q's it is difficult to capture the regime of small x, even for very high values of p. Increasing q, the agreement slightly improves for small x, but, as already remarked, it is more probable that the singularities of the rational interpolation fall close to the domain of the interpolated data. For example, in the case of the dashed magenta curve of Fig.11, all the poles of the rational function are real. Varying the parameter x, they move on the real axis and, whenever one of them comes close to the interpolation region (1, nmax) and it is not too far from n = 1, the extrapolated function to n = 1 cannot be trusted as approximation of the true analytic continuation. This leads to fluctuations or singularities in the extrapolation curve as function of x (e.g. see also the dashed cyan curve in Fig. 11 and the black and magenta curves in Fig. 8)."
