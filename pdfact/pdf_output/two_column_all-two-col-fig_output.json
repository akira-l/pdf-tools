    "text": "Galaxy surveys have suggested that rapid and sustained decrease in the star-formation rate, \"quenching\", in massive disk galaxies is frequently related to the presence of a bar. Optical and near-IR observations reveal that nearly 60% of disk galaxies in the local universe are barred, thus it is important to understand the relationship between bars and star formation in disk galaxies. Recent observational results imply that the Milky Way quenched about 9\u201310 Gyr ago, at the transition between the cessation of the growth of the kinematically hot, old, metal-poor thick disk and the kinematically colder, younger, and more metal-rich thin disk. Although perhaps coincidental, the quenching episode could also be related to the formation of the bar. Indeed the transfer of energy from the large-scale shear induced by the bar to increasing turbulent energy could stabilize the gaseous disk against wide-spread star formation and quench the galaxy. To explore the relation between bar formation and star formation in gas rich galaxies quantitatively, we simulated gas-rich disk isolated galaxies. Our simulations include prescriptions for star formation, stellar feedback, and for regulating the multi-phase interstellar medium. We find that the action of stellar bar efficiently quenches star formation, reducing the star-formation rate by a factor of 10 in less than 1 Gyr. Analytical and self-consistent galaxy simulations with bars suggest that the action of the stellar bar increases the gas random motions within the co-rotation radius of the bar. Indeed, we detect an increase in the gas velocity dispersion up to 20 − 35 km s−1 at the end of the bar formation phase. The star-formation efficiency decreases rapidly, and in all of our models, the bar quenches the star formation in the galaxy. The star-formation efficiency is much lower in simulated barred compared to unbarred galaxies and more rapid bar formation implies more rapid quenching."

    "text": "Understanding the formation and evolution of disk galaxies requires, at a minimum, a detailed knowledge of the star-formation history of the ensemble of galaxies. When classified by the relative rates of star formation, galaxies divide into two separate sequences, a red and a blue sequence consisting of ellipticals and lenticulars and spirals and irregulars, respectively (Strateva et al. 2001; Bell et al. 2004). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed transition from blue active star-forming galaxies to red galaxies. These range from invoking the energy output of active galactic nuclei, major mergers initiating starbursts which exhaust the gas, to accreting gas being heated to such a high temperatures that it no longer cools significantly in a Hubble time, to environment effects such a tidal and ram-pressure stripping, to simple gas exhaustion, or the action of bars in disk galaxies. Several of these mechanisms may operate in coordination or simultaneously, perhaps even within the same galaxy."

A number of galaxy formation models (Springel et al. 2005; Bower et al. 2006; Somerville et al. 2008; Oppenheimer et al. 2010; Pontzen et al. 2017), isolated galaxy simulations (Dubois et al. 2014; Gabor & Bournaud 2014) and semianalytic models (Croton et al. 2006; Somerville et al. 2008) have suggested that AGNs are able to suppress star formation rapidly either by removing gas from the galaxy (see e.g., Sijacki et al. 2007; Dubois et al. 2013, and references therein), or by injecting turbulence which stabilizes the gas against fragmentation and becoming self-gravitation on any scale (Guillard et al. 2015; Lanz et al. 2016). Various types of observations confirm that star formation can be suppressed by a factor of 3-50 (e.g., Mullaney et al. 2015; Shimizu et al. 2015) It has long been known that galaxy properties are closely related to the local environmental density (Kauffmann et al. 2004). In dense environments, star formation can be easily quenched by gas removal due to ram-pressure or tidal interactions (George et al. 2011; van der Wel et al. 2010; Walker et al. 2010; Cortese et al. 2011). Schaefer et al. (2017), for example, found that the specific star-formation rate drops by a factor of 4 in dense environments."

Martig et al. (2013) subsequently confirmed a possible role of disk stabilization in a study of local galaxies. A strong advantage of this mechanism is that it can explain the quenching without removing or depleting the gas. However it is not clear if this mechanism is efficient in high redshift galaxies where the fraction of gas in the disk is high, 40-50%. While morphological quenching may be effective in suppressing star formation in early-type galaxies, it is not the mechanism responsible for quenching observed in late-type disks, since they lack any significant spheroid (see, for example Laurikainen et al. 2007)."

    "text": "Bars are a common feature in the inner regions of nearby disk galaxies. Roughly 60% of disk galaxies in the local universe have stellar bars (Eskridge et al. 2000; Menéndez-Delmestre et al. 2007; Knapen et al. 2000; Marinova & Jogee 2007; Hernández-Toledo et al. 2007). Galactic bars very likely play an important role in both secular evolution of disk galaxies (Combes & Sanders 1981; Combes et al. 1990; Debattista et al. 2004; Athanassoula et al. 2005; Athanassoula 2013; Di Matteo et al. 2015; Gadotti et al. 2015, and references therein), and in a dynamical (re-)distribution of gas (Combes & Gerin 1985; Athanassoula 1992, 2000; Romero-Gómez et al. 2007; Berentzen et al. 2007) and metals in the galactic disks (Laurikainen et al. 2004b; Martel et al. 2013; Di Matteo et al. 2013; Seidel et al. 2016). The dynamics of gas in a bar potential is complex, depending on the local environment of the ISM and how the bar evolves (see e.g., Athanassoula 1992; Piner et al. 1995; Englmaier & Shlosman 2000; Wada & Koda 2001; Maciejewski et al. 2002; Regan & Teuben 2004; Fragkoudi et al. 2016). The formation and dynamics of bars is potentially an important mechanism for regulating the evolution of the star-formation rate in disk galaxies. While studies have highlighted a possible link between the star formation and the existence of bars in disk galaxies (see e.g., Laurikainen et al. 2004a; Jogee et al. 2005; Masters et al. 2010; Ellison et al. 2011), by studying the central regions of four strongly barred galaxies, James & Percival (2016) showed that the recent star formation appears to have been suppressed by the bars. By reconstructing the star-formation history of main-sequence galaxies from z = 3 to the present epoch, Gavazzi et al. (2015) found that star-forming galaxies quenched above a mass threshold which increases with increasing redshift. They also noted that in the local Universe there is a sharp increase in the fraction of visually classified strong bars as a function of mass, suggesting that strong bars may be responsible for the quenching observed at high redshifts and bars ability to quench star formation depends on galaxy mass. In such a scenario, the bar sweeps most of the gas into the galactic center, where it is then converted into stars. The vigorousness of the re-sulting bar-induced starburst depends on the mass of the galaxy, with massive barred galaxies converting all the gas funnelled to their centers into stars (Carles et al. 2016)."

    "text": "An analysis of the ErisBH simulation demonstrated that the formation of a bar in a galaxy with a quiet merger history can quench its star formation on kiloparsec scales (Spinoso et al. 2017). They showed that gas can be removed rapidly by the bar in the inner region, preventing any further strong star formation. Cheung et al. (2013) also discussed the possibility that bars are able to quench star formation. Through an analysis of Galaxy Zoo 2 dataset they claim that secular evolution is able to build high enough central densities to act as a quenching mechanism. Complex cases may occur though. Observational results for the galaxy NGC 4371 suggests that, although barred, the quenching of its star formation is very likely an environmental effect (Gadotti et al. 2015). Thus, possible complications due to environmental effects make it even harder to extract a general statement on the ways star formation and quenching proceed in barred galaxies."

    "text": "Since a large fraction of galaxies have a bar at the present epoch and many galaxies (including the Milky Way, see Haywood et al. 2016) passed through a stage of quenching, we want to study the possible relation between the bar formation and quenching phase for Milky Way-type galaxies. This link is intriguing, in particular in the Milky Way, where it has been established that a drastic (about a factor 10) and rapid (in about 1 Gyr) decrease in the star-formation rate occurred approximatively 9 − 10 Gyr ago, at the transition between the formation of the thick and thin disks of our Galaxy. For galaxies with masses similar to the Milky Way, this epoch corresponds also to the time when a substantial increase in the fraction of barred galaxies is observed (Sheth et al. 2008, 2012). It is thus important to understand and quantify if there exists a causal link between these two phenomena. Haywood et al. (2016), for example, proposed that in the Milky Way the action of a stellar bar could have increased the gas turbulence, stabilizing the disk against star formation, quenching its star formation. In this scenario, the suppression of the star formation is not associated to a substantial consumption of the available gas, as in other proposed mechanisms. Indeed, the gas would still be present in the disk at those epochs, but its high turbulence would have significantly limited the star-formation efficiency. Not depleting the gas reservoir is the important element, which, at least for the quenching episode in the Milky Way, has to be the case. There is a continuity in the elemental abundances between the stellar populations that formed before and after the quenching episode, which implies that the gas reservoir was not substantially replenished after the quenching episode (Haywood et al. 2016; Haywood et al. 2017, in prep.)."

We use the code based on the TVD MUSCL scheme (Total Variation Diminishing Multi Upstream Scheme for Conservation Laws) for gas dynamics and TreeCode for gravity calculation (Khoperskov et al. 2014). We incorporate a multi-phase model of the ISM and star-formation prescription (Khoperskov et al. 2013, 2016). We adopted gas cooling and heating rates from (Khoperskov et al. 2013, see Appendix B). This model produces a multi-phase ISM with T ≈ 100 K for cold phase, T ≈ 104 K for warm medium and T ≈ 106 K for hot medium. In these simulations we adopted a gas radiative cooling for metallicity 0.5Z . Star formation from the cold phase gas is based on three criteria (i) Jeans mass criterion (Mgas > MJeans); (ii) temperature threshold (T < 100 K); and (iii) converging flow ∇ · v < 0. We create a stellar particle in a gaseous cell when hydrodynamical variables satisfy all these star formation criteria. Note, in particular, that the adoption of a convergent flow criterion in star formation prescription is widely accepted in the literature (see for instance Dobbs et al. 2011; Cole et al. 2014; Marasco et al. 2015; Athanassoula et al. 2016). These works also use converging flow criteria for star formation in isolated galaxy simulations and they have a spatial resolution in the range of 40 − 70 pc."

The galaxy is composed of 106 particles of \"dark matter\", and 106 \"stellar particles\" for the initial disk. Equilibrium distribution functions for these components are found by using the method described in Rodionov et al. (2009). For the gaseous disk component (for both types of models) we adopted a computational domain 30 × 30 × 8 kpc with a uniform grid and a spatial resolution of 50 pc. All parameters (masses, spatial scales and etc.) of our models are listed in We performed a set of isolated galaxy simulations, evolving them for 2 Gyr since we are only interested in modeling bar formation and its impact on the star-formation history, rather than their long term, secular evolution. We simulated a total of 12 models: 2 rigid, axisymmetric models; 8 rigid asymmetric models with a bar whose strength can vary from εb = 0.1 to εb = 1, and whose formation timescale has been varied from h = 0.2 Gyr to h = 1 Gyr; 2 self-consistent simulations, with a live halo and live initial stellar disk. All model parameters are given in Table 1. For all models, we used the star-formation prescription described previously, except for the three models marked with minus in Table 1. For these three simulations, we used a star-formation prescription without the converging flow criterion. As we will discuss subsequently, not including this criterion allows us to clarify the role of random gas motions on the calculated star-formation history (SFH). We start our analysis with two fiducial models (barred RB and unbarred RA) and then the effect of varying parameters is studied by using further 8 models with rigid bar potential. Finally we discuss our \"self-consistent\" simulations."

Stars form throughout the whole disk, with star-formation rate surface-density following the gas distribution and recently formed stars trace the gas structures well. After this initial phase, lasting for less than 1 Gyr, the large scale structures dissipate rapidly and the models then follow a quasi-steady evolution of the disk. Flocculent spiral structures are short lived because the disk tends to be heated up by the action of the spiral waves (see e.g., Thomasson et al. 1991; Carlberg & Sellwood 1985; Sellwood 2011) which in turn stabilizes the disk against non-axisymmetric perturbations."

There is a strong redistribution of the gas at initial stages of evolution (t < 0.2 − 0.5 Gyr), coinciding with the formation of the bar, and after 0.5 Gyr a bar pattern is clearly visible both in the gaseous and young stellar component. Relative to the size of the bar, an extended outer spiral structure also arises in the disk. The bar is able to influence the spiral pattern outside of its co-rotation. At later times, star formation mostly occurs over a small fraction of the disk, mainly along the bar major axis. Recently formed stars also trace similar patterns and form both along the bar and the trailing spiral structure which is still visible after 2 Gyr of evolution. The spiral structure appears to be much weaker in the underlying stellar distribution. There is also a strong, ≈ 109 M , mass concentration of gas in the very center (< 1 kpc) because the stellar bar potential drives a gas flow inside the inner Lindblad resonance (see e.g. Athanassoula 1992).

With time, the unbarred galaxy shows a monotonic decrease of SFR at large radii (r > 5 kpc), whereas the inner regions, r < 5 kpc, the SFR is nearly constant. That it is the amount of gas available at a given radius the main driver of the temporal evolution of the SFR in the unbarred galaxy (Fig. 5).

After an initial peak, at about t=0.25 Gyr, just after the growth of the bar has ended, the SFR generally decreases. Over the innermost region, r < 3 kpc, after an initial decrease, the SFR is constant for t > 0.7 Gyr. At intermediate radii, 3 − 7 kpc, the star-formation rate decreases by a factor of 5 − 10. Star formation is mostly absent/suppressed within the bar radius except for the strong gas concentration area along the bar major axis (Fig. 2). The overall SFR decreases by a factor of about 10. Comparing the evolution of the SFR and gas mass over the same regions in the barred model, we see that the decrease in the SFR observed in the inner regions is not due to a decrease in the gas mass. Perhaps surprisingly, the decrease in the SFR occurs while there is an increase in the gas content within about 3 kpc of the galactic center. This indicates that gas is losing angular momentum and flows inwards accumulating in the center. Once there, it is not converted into stars with the same efficiency observed for the unbarred model, otherwise we would expect a corresponding increase of the SFR in the center of the disk."

It is clear that in the unbarred galaxy, the star-formation efficiency is roughly constant in the inner regions, r < 5, both in time and in space (Fig. 6). It is only in the outer disk of the unbarred model that the SFE decreases by a factor of a few.

In the centers of gas-rich barred galaxies, it appears that an increase in the gas content is accompanied by a decrease in the SFR. It is widely accepted that there are several small and large scale possible processes which regulate star formation in galactic disks (McKee & Ostriker 2007; Dobbs et al. 2014).

For instance, Dib et al. (2006) established that a dispersion of 10 km s−1 can be sustained by a surface star formation rate of about (1 − 2) × 10−3 M yr−1 kpc−2 . There is potentially enough energy and momentum in supernovae, radiative feedback and stellar winds but it is not clear whether they are deposited efficiently within gas in the disk. Circumstantial evidence against stellar feedback as a direct source of turbulence is the lack of correlation between the level of the velocity dispersion and the proximity to star-forming clumps (see e.g. Förster Schreiber et al. 2009; Genzel et al. 2011)."

Galactic bar rotation can supply an effectively inexhaustible amount of kinetic energy to power turbulence in the ISM, where shocks can efficiently transform some of the available bulk rotational energy into random gas motions. Since most of the gas in the central part is pushed by the bar potential, this gas can have a relatively large velocity dispersion which in turn would affect the star-formation efficiency. The drivers of the turbulent component of the velocity dispersion are gravity and shear. In the presence of a bar, the leading shock waves swing in the center and amplify, inducing gravitational torques in the gas and hence increasing gas streaming motions and the local velocity dispersion (see e.g., Kim et al. 2002; Kim & Ostriker 2007). Such a process converts ordered circular motion of the gas to random velocities, hence tapping rotational energy from the disk. Numerical simulations clearly show that the stellar bar in NGC 2915 enhances the ISM velocity dispersion (Wada et al. 2002)."

To check that the bar action provides an increase in the gas random motions we calculate the gas velocity dispersion for each two-dimensional position in the disk for the face-on galaxy configuration. We calculate the velocity dispersion for each component of the gas velocity (radial, azimuthal and vertical) in columns across the disk plane. Then we calculate the mean gas velocity dispersion for each position x, y in face on map: where σR, σφ, σz are the velocity dispersions in the various directions. In Fig. 7 we plot the total gas velocity dispersion in the barred galaxy simulation. We find that the bar region is characterized by a high gas velocity dispersion, which can locally reach up to 25 − 35 km s−1 . To check the role of the gas velocity dispersion definition, we also compare our definition Eq. 4 with a simple line-of-sight gas velocity dispersion for the same face-on galaxy configuration which is simply the vertical gas velocity dispersion σz. In Fig. 7 (center) we can clearly see that there is nice spatial correlation between σz and σgas. We also see that higher vertical gas velocity dispersion coincides well with the bar position. However, the most important consequence of this picture is the relative increase of the gas random motions in the bar region in comparison to unbarred configuration."

To demonstrate this point quantitatively we show the relation between disk thickness, defined as the mean absolute value of the mass weighted vertical position of gas, versus square of gas velocity dispersion (see Eq. 4) for unbarred (RA) and barred galaxy simulation (RB) at 1.2 Gyr and within inner 5 kpc (Fig. 9).

From this point of view, our results are in agreement with the mechanism of morphological quenching (Martig et al. 2009). In Martig et al. (2009), the disk is stabilized due to the growth of the dynamically hot spheroid which is built up by successive mergers. In another words, the quenching mechanism is the result of the increase of the stellar velocity dispersion induced by interactions. In this study, we propose a mechanism for the stabilization of the gaseous disk that does not need environment to play any role.

Central star formation rate is close to the intensity of starburst galaxies (see e.g., Kennicutt 1998), because the maximum of the star formation occurs in the central region where the SFR is in the range 6 − 8 M yr−1 (see Fig. 5). Meanwhile, much less efficient outer star formation is similar to those found in nearby galaxies (Bigiel et al. 2010)."

We showed that averaged SFE in the bar region decreases by a factor of 2 − 10 in comparison to the unbarred galaxy simulation (Fig. 6). When the disk is quenching, the Kennicutt-Schmidt like relation is also different from the behavior observed in the unbarred galaxy. Figure 10 shows the relation ΣSFR − Σgas at 1.2 Gyr calculated for the barred galaxy. The barred galaxy simulation contains the same amount of gas as the unbarred one, whereas non-axisymmetric bar action results in much higher densities. There is also a clear variation in the SFE with radius that is overall similar to the unbarred galaxy (Fig. 6), with a decrease by a factor of 10 from the inner to the outer disk. The bar has little impact on the outer disk as the SFE is already low there."

Most pixels agree well with K-S-type relation meanwhile the filling factor of suppressed star formation regions is low. At the same time, the K-S relation for the middle and outer parts of the disk is roughly the same for barred and unbarred galaxy models. In the densest regions which lie along the bar major axis and in the central over density and where the gas surface density can reach up to 103 M pc−2 , we find a very wide range of star-formation efficiencies. The SFE of regions where there is very dense gas is significantly reduced, which explains the overall lower star-formation rate. However, the high amount of gas still generates a higher star-formation rate than in the outer disk, where star formation always contributes only a small fraction of the total SFR."

In Fig. 12 we plot the K-S relation for a simulation with a gas fraction of 10%. Also for this model, the slope of the K-S relation is ≈ 1.4 in the disk, while in a limited region at high densities the relation appears to have a flatter slope, of ≈ 1. So, while a hint of a flattening in the K-S relation is visible also for the barred, gas-poor galaxy, it is clear that the effect is much stronger in gas-rich systems. Currently, only few studies have compared the SFE in the bar region and outside it. They generally reach the conclusion that SFEs in bars are lower than in the surrounding disk. Momose et al. (2010), for example, have studied NGC 4303, a barred galaxy, and shown that the K-S relation appears flatter in the bar region than in the surrounding disk. They show indeed that there is active star formation in the spiral arms, while in the bar region the SFE is lower by a factor of ≈ 2. For the barred galaxy NGC 1530, Reynaud & Downes (1998) claimed that the star formation is inhibited at the places where the shocks and the shear are strong enough. By making an analysis of radial distributions of the different types of supernovae Hakobyan et al. (2016) reported about the substantial suppression of massive star formation in the radial range swept by strong bars."

Note however, that none of these studies concern galaxies at high redshift or particularly gas-rich. Here we suggest that the mechanism of the bar-induced quenching is efficient in gas-rich galaxies and the flattening of the K-S relation in the central regions may also be considered as a prediction to be checked with observations of high-redshift, or local gas-rich galaxies."

The difference in gas dynamics between the bar and spiral arms may be the cause of this higher efficiency. The gas density and SFR are the highest in the nuclear region. SFE varies strongly with local conditions, but the locally averaged SFE in the nucleus is relatively low. The local values of SFE are constant in the circumnuclear overdensity and in the bar, and it increases toward the spiral arms. The comparison of SFE in the bar and spiral arms shows that SFE is about twice as high in the arms as those in the bar. Extreme SFE is found in the spiral arms, but not in the bar, indicates that the efficient triggering of star formation is related not only to the local gas density, but also to the local gas dynamics."

The impact of the bar occurs at later times for slower bar formation regimes and the timescale of quenching itself is proportional to the bar formation timescale. In all cases of the bar parameters we simulated1, the quenching of the SF appears after about 1 Gyr from the beginning of the simulation, and coincides with the epoch of maximal growth of the bar.

By self-consistent, we mean that the galaxy is composed of a live stellar and gaseous disks, and a live dark matter halo. In contrast to the simulations we have discussed, the bar potential is not imposed analytically. In these simulations, a stellar bar naturally forms after 0.5 Gyr. It arises as the result of energy and angular momentum redistribution within the galaxy. The disadvantage over our previously discussed simulation is that we now need to estimate the bar strength, which will generally depend on time. To quantify the strength of the bar, we use the m = 2 Fourier moment A2 of the density distribution in the following way: A2 = ∑ mk exp (2iφk) , (5) where mk is the mass of k-th particle and summation is carried out over both initial and recently formed stellar particles. We find that the disc develops a strong bar whose length is ≈ 5 kpc at the end of simulation. The bar strength increases from the beginning of the simulation and reaches a saturation level after about 1 Gyr (Fig. 15)."

Globally, in the case of no converging flow, bar formation reduces the star-formation rate by a factor of few which is much slower than in our fiducial runs. At the end of the simulation (after 2 Gyr), SFR is still high: ≈ 3 M yr−1 for rigid bar simulation and ≈ 7 M yr−1 for self-consistent run.

We introduce simple quenching parameters. First, we estimate the quenching timescale hq as an exponential timescale for the star-formation rate decrease: SFR(t) ∝ exp(−t/hq) . (6) To make the fit, we did not use the whole time span of the simulations, but only the period when star formation is suppressed. The second parameter is the quenching rate ζ which we take as the ratio between the maximum star formation rate before star formation suppression and its value after the quenching phase: ζ = SFR(before quenching)/SFR(after quenching) . (7) For each model star-formation history we measure these two parameters and analyze them as a function of the main bar parameters (Fig. 17) For this analysis we also added two models with no bar in order to distinguish quantitatively whether quenching has occurred in a given run. Finally we estimate the quenching parameters according to Eqs. 6 and 7, for the Milky Way star-formation history derived from fitting the solar vicinity age-[Si/Fe] abundance with a chemical evolution model (Snaith et al. 2015). Quenching parameters for the MW have been estimated by analyzing the mean star-formation rates during the thick (9 − 11 Gyr ago) and thin (< 8 Gyr) disks formation phases taking into account the estimated uncertainties in the SFR. For the quenching time scale, we find 0.6 − 2 Gyr and for quenching rate, 8 − 12."

Haywood et al. (2016) confirmed these results by showing that the bimodality of the [α/Fe] distribution visible in the APOGEE data in the entire inner disk can be reproduced if its star formation was quenched at the end of the formation of the thick disk. This quenching episode occurred throughout the inner disk (. 7 kpc of the galactic center). In contradiction with many quenching models, the data suggest however that the quenching did not occur because of the exhaustion of gas. The chemical continuity observed on stars formed before and after the quenching episode excludes the possibility that substantial amounts of gas was accreted during this period. This implies that the disk at the end of the quenching epoch possessed a sufficient reservoir of gas to resume star formation and form the thin disk."

    "text": "Haywood et al. (2016) suggested that the bar could be responsible for the quenching over this epoch in the MW by increasing the turbulence in the gas, preventing altogether the gas from collapsing, becoming self-gravitating, and forming stars. Indeed, the quenching of the star formation has been observed in local galaxies despite them having substantial gas reservoirs. For example, Rowlands et al. (2015) and French et al. (2015) discovered significant molecular reservoirs in post-starburst galaxies which is inconsistent with their star-formation rate in comparison to normal galaxies. K-S relation for some of these post-starburst galaxies suggests that the star-formation efficiency is lower by a factor of ≈ 20 for a given molecular gas mass. Alatalo et al. (2015b) proposed that most of the molecular gas in NGC 1266 is very inefficient at forming stars. The most likely explanation for the suppression of SF in dense gas is that turbulence dissipation rate is long enough and the energy high enough to keep the gas from collapsing gravitationally. Thus the sustained turbulence is a reasonable explanation for suppressing star formation. The cloud, G0.253 + 0.016, is one example of where star formation is surpressed by turbulence. This cloud is located in the galactic center, has a lower star-formation efficiency compared to similar clouds and has an especially high gas velocity dispersion (Kauffmann et al. 2013). These results and others (see, e.g., Alatalo et al. 2015a; Guillard et al. 2015) find that it is not necessary to substantially remove gas reservoirs to quench or suppress star formation in galaxies on global or local scales."

This scenario is different from the one proposed by Gavazzi et al. (2015), where the star formation is quenched by sweeping the gas with the bar to the Galactic center. As already discussed in Haywood et al. (2016), we feel this solution is not appropriate for the Milky Way, since once the gas is swept to the Galaxy center, it needs to be replenished to allow the thin (very extended) disk to form. The accretion of new gas would leave a signature in the abundances, while the data shows strict continuity between the thick and thin disks. On these grounds, such a model cannot be appropriate for the MW."

Bar shocks injecting substantial turbulent energy into galactic disk within bar co-rotation and the turbulence stabilize the molecular gas against collapse. In this mechanism, the gas content from galactic disks does not need to be expelled for galaxies to quench. The underlying mechanism for bar quenching is simply to stir-up the gas to high dispersions. It is through these high velocity dispersions that star-formation efficiency is decreased. This mechanism, high dispersions suppressing star formation has been confirmed both empirically, phenomenologically, and numerically. However, many aspects of bar quenching and the impact of turbulence on star formation remain mysterious, such as understanding in detail how the bar rotational energy is transferred to the gas on large and small scales, how rapidly this energy dissipates as function of bar parameters, galaxy-type and mass, etc."

    "text": "This study emphasizes the fundamental role that stellar bars play in influencing the gas dynamics on large scales within gas-rich galaxy disks and thereby in modulating galaxy star-formation histories. Using N-body/hydrodynamical simulations of gas-rich barred galaxies, we find that star-formation history strongly depends on the formation and evolution of bars. The results of our simulations show that it is possible to suppress the star formation in barred galaxies by collecting most of the gas in the bar-region and then by inducing significant random gas motions through the shear and modulating gravitational potential generated by the rotation of the bar. We find that the formation of bars is responsible for quenching star formation in gas-rich disks of galaxies. These findings strongly support the idea that a bar may have had a substantial impact on the star-formation history of the Milky Way (Haywood et al. 2016). Haywood et al. (2016) found that a decrease in the SFR by a factor of 10 occurring within 1 Gyr is needed to explain the chemical abundances in the disk. They proposed that the bar could be at the origin of the quenching by increasing the turbulence in the ISM. At least with the detailed data we have on the Milky Way, it appears that the rise of the stellar asymmetries in the disk could be the origin of the transition from the thick disk to the thin disk populations. The results above imply that it is essential to compute the bar evolution and multi-phase ISM self-consistently in order to understand star-formation history of spiral galaxies and their quenching phase."
